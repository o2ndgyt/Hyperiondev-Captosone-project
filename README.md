# Hyperiondev - Capstone Project l: Build a Complete Website

In your previous HTML/CSS Capstone, I used HTML and CSS to create a website. The next part of this project will focus on JavaScript — the language that adds the background functionality and animations on all the beautiful websites you see. I tasked with a set of JavaScript requirements to enhance a basic site with certain functionality. 

My website is required to implement the following:

- [x] Create a functional “Save for later” page for your website, where users can earmark articles, images, recipes, etc. in a personal folder to be able to go back and see them later.
- [x] Each item/recipe/image, etc. must have the option to “Save for later”.
- [x] When an item is added, an alert should tell the user how many items are in their “Save for later” folder.
- [x] Create a new HTML page for the “Save for later” section, which allows the user to see what is in their folder.
- [x] Create a form which allows a user to leave comments.
- [x] Create forms to allow a user to “like” an item/article/etc.
- [x] Create forms for if a person would like to contact you.
