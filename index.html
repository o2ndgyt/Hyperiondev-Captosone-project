                <p>
                    Freelancers are a big part of the UK’s self-employed workforce. They work on shorter-term projects
                    for a
                    variety of clients on a contract-by-contract basis.

                    They usually have specialist skills that they can market to clients, who like using freelancers
                    because it’s
                    flexible. It gives them access to expertise without the need for long-term employment commitments,
                    which is
                    particularly useful for start-ups and earlier-stage businesses.

                    For their part, freelancers often enjoy this freedom and flexibility too. Freelancers should see
                    themselves
                    as running their own business, as they have to actively win work and deal with admin like tax and
                    invoicing.

                    Freelancers come in many guises, but here are the top five occupations according to IPSE (these
                    account for
                    almost 50 per cent of all UK freelancers):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>artistic, media and literary</li>
                    <li>teaching</li>
                    <li>managers and proprietors in other services</li>
                    <li>functional managers and directors</li>
                    <li>sports and fitness occupations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Shift your perspective before going freelance</h3>
                <p>
                    You could be considering leaving a job to start your own business, or might even be a student
                    mulling over
                    next steps. Whatever your experience, prepare for a shift in perspective when becoming freelance.
                    Think
                    about the responsibilities, commitments, and personal ‘non-negotiables’ that, when combined, map out
                    your
                    lifestyle and circumstances.

                    The obvious ones are family commitments and financial responsibilities.

                    With a regular paycheque you have income, and often as a result of that secure income you start
                    building up
                    liabilities. These might be rent or a mortgage, plus all those Direct Debits you know are going to
                    go out
                    each month, usually as soon as you’ve been paid.

                    You could drop some of these easily if necessary, for example a gym membership or Netflix account.
                    But what
                    would happen if you missed a utility bill? Are you in the middle of any building work? Paying
                    childcare fees
                    or getting a credit card under control?

                    If you’re giving up a regular salary to become a freelancer, make sure you have a complete picture
                    of your
                    income and outgoings, and minimise the risk of missed payments.

                    This will also be a useful task if you’re not employed at the moment, but are weighing up the pros
                    and cons
                    of freelancing against regular employment. You can consider the sort of lifestyle you want to have.

                <h3>Work out your freelancer fees and rates</h3>
                <p>
                    Working out how much you’re going to charge is possibly the most important part of becoming a
                    freelancer.
                    Your earnings could come in either as flat project-based fees, or as daily (or hourly) rates.

                    Do some basic research and get a sense of the going rate for your services or skill set. Of course,
                    it’s
                    going to depend on your level of experience, but there’s no sense in charging rock-bottom rates only
                    to find
                    that you can't afford to pay your bills.

                    Remember the importance here of building up a good reputation and referrals. Earn the respect and
                    trust of a
                    group of solid clients with reasonably-charged work, executed to brief, on time and to a high
                    standard.

                    Working out how to become a freelancer who’s indispensable to your clients will be the key to your
                    self-employed success.
